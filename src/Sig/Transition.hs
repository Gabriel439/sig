-- | This module provides the `Transition` type

module Sig.Transition
    ( -- * Transition
      Transition(..)

import Dhall (Interpret)
import GHC.Generics (Generic)
import Sig.State (State(..))

{-| The `Transition` type encodes one step of the state machine state that each
    initial state transitions to.  For example, the following transition:

> Transition
>     { fromState00To = S03
>     , fromState01To = S02

    ... specifies that if the state machine is currently in State @#0@ then the
    state machine should transition to state @3@ or if the state machine is
    currently in State @#1@ then the state machine should transition to state
    @2@

    You can create a `Transition` by:

    * using the `Transition` constructor
    * using the `buildTransition` function
    * decoding a `Transition` from a `Data.ByteString.Lazy.ByteString` using the
      `Binary` instance
    * decoding a `Transition` from a Dhall expression using the `Interpret`
      instance
    * using `mempty`, which represents the `Transition` that does nothing

    You can combine `Transition`s by:

    * using @`mappend` x y@, which represents the transition @x@ followed by the
      transition @y@

    You can consume `Transition`s:

    * indirectly, using `Sig.run` and `Sig.runInParallel`
    * directly, by encoding a `Transition` to a
      `Data.ByteString.Lazy.ByteString` using the `Binary` instance

{-| Build a `Transition` from a function

    This comes in handy when you want to use Haskell's support for wildcard
    pattern matches to avoid having to specify every `State`

    For example:

> buildTransition (\state -> case state of
>     S00 -> S01
>     S01 -> S02
>     S02 -> S02
>     _   -> S00 )
-}

buildTransition f = Transition {..}

    fromState00To = f S00
    fromState01To = f S01
    fromState02To = f S02
    fromState03To = f S03
    fromState04To = f S04
    fromState05To = f S05
    fromState06To = f S06
